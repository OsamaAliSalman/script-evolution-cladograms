# script-evolution-cladograms
This repository contains cladogram images generated from the analysis of historical
scripts and script variants using feature selection techniques. The cladograms represent 
the phylogenetic relationships between different script systems, shedding light on their 
evolutionary history. The research aims to understand how scripts have evolved over time
and how they are influenced by various cultural and technological factors. The cladograms 
are obtained through the application of maximum parsimony and feature selection algorithms, 
providing insights into the most parsimonious evolutionary scenarios for the examined scripts
